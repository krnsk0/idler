I am writing copy for an idle strategy video game. The video game is hard sci-fi themed, but as the game unfolds it becomes clear that there is a subtle theme of horror with elements of satire, in addition to the hard sci-fi theme. The player is the commander of a small colony started on an alien world after a colony ship crashes there.

The player interacts with the AI of the colony ship, who is called simply, "Ship." This AI is initially a friendly, helpful character, offering various technologies to the player that allow them to harvest resources and construct buildings, among other things. But, over time, it becomes clear that the player is not really in control, and is advancing a hidden agenda on the part of Ship. The effect on the player should be one that accumulates slowly over time, and the horror element must not be too explicit. The aim is to make it graudally clear that the colony is a dystopia.

Each technology or building when first unlocked has some splash text which is shown to the player. This splash text is one of the main means to establish the tone and feel of the game-- as well as advance the narrative. The splash text is usually no more than 80 words and about two sentences.

Here are some examples of the splash text I have so far for technologies offered by the Ship which the player can research:
AGRONOMY: with some training in xenobiology, colonists can increase food production
ARBORICULTURE: with training in the biology of arboriform xenoflora, colonists can increase tree farm productivity
BIOMASS COMPRESSION: subject to heat and pressure, biomass becomes an arboraceous material suitable for construction
CONSTRUCTION: techniques and tools outpost expansion
CRYONICS: in the wreckage, thousands sleep in suspended animation. ship says it can wake them
ELECTROMAGNETISM: allow the construction of additional generators
EXCAVATION: ship detects mineral deposits beneath the planet's surface
FARMING: rudimentary applied xenobotany
FORESTRY: sustainable cultivation of arboriform xenoflora
GEOLOGY: with some training in mining geology, colonists can increase mine productivity
METALLURGY: might the ore yield a useful alloy?
NEURAL REPROGRAMMING: ship suggests a means to equip colonists with advanced skills via accelerated learning
SHELTER: primitive protection from the elements
STORAGE: facilities for long-term warehousing
SUBSURFACE EXCAVATION: delve deeper for useful mineral ores
TEMPERATURE CONTROL: techniques and tools for controlling endothermic reactions
ZONE UPGRADES: ship proposes a means to make lasting improvements to the settlement


These are examples of splash text for buildings
CACHE: a structure for stockpiling resources
DYNAMO: generate electrical potential from exothermic, self-perpetuating reaction
FARM: a triumph of xenobotany
FURNACE: uses endothermic reduction to extract a malleable alloy from the ore
HABITAT: protection from the elements for one colonist
MINE: extract subsurface mineral deposits
TREE FARM: sustainably cultivate arboraceous xenoflora

Give me ten variants on the NEURAL REPROGRAMMING technology splash text that slightly, subtly enhance the contribution this splash text makes toward the survival horror, dystopian element of the game's tone.
